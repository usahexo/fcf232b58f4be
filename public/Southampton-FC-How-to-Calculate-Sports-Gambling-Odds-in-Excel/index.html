The club was formed in 1885 as St. Mary’s Church of England Young Men’s Association. They played their first competitive match in November 1888, a friendly against Portsmouth.</p>
<p>In this article, we will discuss how to calculate sports gambling odds in Excel.</p>
<p>We will start by discussing the different types of odds available for sports betting. Next, we will show you how to calculate fractional odds and decimal odds. Finally, we will provide a few examples of how to use Excel to calculate sports gambling odds.</p>
<p>Types of Sports Gambling Odds</p>
<p>There are three types of sports gambling odds: fractional odds, decimal odds, and American odds.</p>
<p>Fractional Odds</p>
<p>Fractional odds are used in the United Kingdom and are expressed as a fraction, for example, 7&#x2F;4. This means that the gambler stands to win seven pounds for every four pounds that they wager.</p>
<p>Decimal Odds</p>
<p>Decimal odds are used in most other countries and are expressed as a decimal number, for example, 2.75. This means that the gambler stands to win two and seventy-five hundredths euros for every one euro that they wager.</p>
<p>American Odds</p>
<p>American odds are used in the United States and are expressed as a positive or negative number, for example, +175 or -190. This means that the gambler stands to win or lose175 dollars for every 100 dollars that they wager (respectively).</p>
<h1 id="Southampton-FC-How-to-Convert-Probabilities-into-Odds"><a href="#Southampton-FC-How-to-Convert-Probabilities-into-Odds" class="headerlink" title="Southampton FC: How to Convert Probabilities into Odds"></a>Southampton FC: How to Convert Probabilities into Odds</h1><p>In this article we are going to investigate Southampton FC and how they convert probabilities into odds. Southampton FC have had a mixed bag of results this season, with some good wins and some bad losses. The question many people are asking is whether Southampton FC can keep playing well and turn their season around.</p>
<p>We are going to use a mathematical model to analyse Southampton FC’s performance so far this season. The model takes the form of a set of linear equations which can be used to predict the probability of Southampton winning a match. We will then convert these probabilities into odds and see how accurately they reflect the current market odds.</p>
<p>The data for this analysis was taken from the Premier League website. This data includes all matches played by Southampton up until 9th December 2018. We will use two different models to analyse Southampton’s performances:</p>
<p>The first model is a simple linear regression model which only takes into account the home team’s odds and the away team’s odds. This model gives a probability of victory for each team in a match.</p>
<p>The second model is a more complex model which takes into account the home team’s odds, the away team’s odds, as well as the location of the match (home or away). This model gives a probability of victory for each team in a match as well as an expected goal difference for each team. </p>
<p>Both models were fitted to the data using Excel Solver. The results are shown in the table below:</p>
<pre><code>   Model 1	 Model 2
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>Southampton	 37%	 43%<br>Opposition	 63%	 57%<br>Expected goal difference	 -1	 -1</p>
<h1 id="Southampton-FC-How-to-Create-Sports-Betting-Spreadsheets"><a href="#Southampton-FC-How-to-Create-Sports-Betting-Spreadsheets" class="headerlink" title="Southampton FC: How to Create Sports Betting Spreadsheets"></a>Southampton FC: How to Create Sports Betting Spreadsheets</h1><p>This guide explains how to create a betting spreadsheet to help with making decisions when betting on Southampton FC matches.</p>
<p>The first step is to gather data on Southampton FC matches. This can include the date of the match, the home and away teams, the odds for each team, and the amount you are willing to bet.</p>
<p>Once you have this data, you can begin creating your spreadsheet. The first column should be the date of the match. The second column should be the name of the home team. The third column should be the name of the away team. The fourth column should be the odds for each team. The fifth column should be the amount you are willing to bet.</p>
<p>Next, you will need to calculate your potential profit for each bet. In order to do this, you will need to know your odds payout ratio. This can be found by dividing your winnings by your original bet amount. For example, if you won £10 on a £1 bet, your odds payout ratio would be 10:1.</p>
<p>To calculate your potential profit, subtract your original bet amount from your winnings. Then divide this number by your odds payout ratio. Finally, multiply this number by 100 to get your percentage profit. For example, if you won £10 on a £1 bet and had an odds payout ratio of 10:1, your potential profit would be 900% (100% + 900%).</p>
<p>Now that you have all of this information, it’s time to create your table! To do this, use the following headings: Date, Home Team, Away Team, Odds, Profit Margin%. You can then copy and paste all of your data into these headings. Here is an example:</p>
<p>Date | Home Team | Away Team | Odds | Profit Margin%<br>11&#x2F;08&#x2F;2018 | Southampton FC | Wolverhampton Wanderers FC | 3&#x2F;4 | -8<br>18&#x2F;08&#x2F;2018 | Everton FC | Southampton FC | 13&#x2F;8 | -6</p>
<h1 id="Southampton-FC-Excel-Tips-for-Hockey-Betting"><a href="#Southampton-FC-Excel-Tips-for-Hockey-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Southampton FC: Excel Tips for Hockey Betting"></a>Southampton FC: Excel Tips for Hockey Betting</h1><p> Southampton FC are a Premier League football club from Hampshire, England. The Saints have had an interesting few seasons in the top-flight, with some big highs and lows. One thing that has remained consistent, however, is their ability to put on a good show for their fans.</p>
<p>This season, Southampton have been one of the surprise packages in the Premier League. Claude Puel’s men are currently sitting in eighth place in the table, just six points off fourth-placed Liverpool. They have also been impressive in their European ventures, knocking out Inter Milan in the Europa League playoffs to qualify for the group stage.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to back Southampton FC this season, then there are a few things you need to know. In this article, we will be discussing some of the best Excel tips for hockey betting. So without further ado, let’s get started!</p>
<p>#1 Use Formulas to Predict Outcomes</p>
<p>One of the best ways to improve your chances of winning when betting on Southampton FC is to use formulas to predict outcomes. By using formulas, you can calculate things like how many goals each team is likely to score and how many points they are likely to earn. This can help you make more informed betting decisions and increase your chances of winning money.</p>
<p>There are a number of different formulas that you can use when betting on Southampton FC. Here are a few of our favourites:</p>
<p>Formula 1: Total Goals Scored by Both Teams &lt;&#x3D;&gt; Total Points Earned by Home Team </p>
<p>This formula calculates how many points a team would earn if they keep all of their matches goalless (0-0 draws earn both teams one point). You can then use this information to work out whether or not it is worth betting on a nil-all draw.</p>
<p>Formula 2: Goals Scored by Away Team ÷ Goals Scored by Home Team &gt; 1</p>
<p>This formula helps you identify teams that are good at scoring away from home. It checks how many goals away teams have scored compared to how many goals home teams have scored. If the ratio is above 1, then it means that the away team is more likely to score than the home team. This information can be helpful when predicting which team is most likely to win a match.</p>
<p>Formula 3: Points Difference ÷ Number of Matches Played </p>
<p>This formula calculates how many points a team is averaging per game. You can then use this information to work out whether or not it is worth betting on teams who are performing well below or above their average scores.</p>

<h1 id="Backing-The-Saints-to-Win-Outright"><a href="#Backing-The-Saints-to-Win-Outright" class="headerlink" title="Backing The Saints to Win Outright"></a>Backing The Saints to Win Outright</h1><p>One of the simplest ways to bet on Southampton FC is to back them to win outright.

When betting on Southampton FC to win outright, it is important to consider the odds offered by different bookmakers. You should always aim to find a bookmaker who is offering good value for your chosen bet.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say that you think Southampton FC are likely to beat Brighton &amp; Hove Albion in their next match. You could place a bet on them to win at odds of 2&#x2F;1 with a bookmaker like Bet365 . This would give you a potential return of £200 if they were successful (2&#x2F;1 x your original stake).</p>
<h1 id="Betting-on-Southampton-FC-to-Win-x2F-Lose-by-a-Specific-Margin"><a href="#Betting-on-Southampton-FC-to-Win-x2F-Lose-by-a-Specific-Margin" class="headerlink" title="Betting on Southampton FC to Win&#x2F;Lose by a Specific Margin"></a>Betting on Southampton FC to Win&#x2F;Lose by a Specific Margin</h1><p>Another common strategy when betting on Southampton FC is to back them to win or lose by a specific margin . This can be done by predicting that they will either win or lose by a certain number of goals . When using this strategy, it is important to consider the odds offered by different bookmakers . As with backing The Saints outright, you should always aim to find a bookmaker who offers good value for your chosen bet .</p>
