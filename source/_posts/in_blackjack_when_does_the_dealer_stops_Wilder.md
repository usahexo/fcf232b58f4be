# In Blackjack, When Does the Dealer Stop? Insights from Wilder

Thornton Wilder was an American playwright and novelist known for his works such as "Our Town" and "The Bridge of San Luis Rey". Although he was not a professional blackjack player, his insights can shed light on the rules surrounding when the dealer stops in the game of blackjack. In this article, we will explore when the dealer stops in blackjack as explained by Wilder.

## Understanding the Basics of Blackjack

Before discussing when the dealer stops in blackjack, it is important to understand the basics of the game. Blackjack is a card game that is played with one or more decks of standard playing cards. The objective of the game is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's hand value without going over 21. Players win their bets if their hand is higher than the dealer's hand or if the dealer busts.

## When Does the Dealer Stop in Blackjack?

In blackjack, the dealer must follow specific rules for when to hit and when to stand. The rules vary depending on the casino and the specific variation of blackjack being played. However, in general, the dealer must hit on any hand with a total of 16 or less and stand on any hand with a total of 17 or more.

According to Wilder, understanding when the dealer stops in blackjack is crucial for making strategic decisions at the table. Players must constantly calculate the value of their hand and determine whether to hit (take another card), stand (keep their current hand), or double down (double their bet and take one more card).

## Conclusion

Knowing when the dealer stops in blackjack is an important part of mastering the game. By following insights from Wilder and understanding the basic rules for when the dealer hits and stands, you can make more informed decisions and feel more confident at the table. However, it is important to remember that gambling can be addictive and should be approached responsibly. With insights from Wilder, you can take your blackjack skills to the next level and become a more successful and knowledgeable player.
