#  How to Start Playing Dragon Tiger at the Casino 

Dragon Tiger is a popular casino game that originated in Asia. The game is played with two cards- a Dragon card and a Tiger card. The object of the game is to bet on which of the two cards will be higher when turned over.

If you’re new to Dragon Tiger, don’t worry – we’ll walk you through the basics of how to play. First, you need to decide how much money you want to bet. You can then place your bet on the table by placing your chips in the betting circle next to your chosen outcome. 

The dealer will then deal two cards face up, one for the dragon and one for the tiger. The higher card of the two will win and the dealer will payout all bets that are placed on that outcome. If both cards are equal, then the result is a draw and no one wins or loses money. 

Here are some tips for winning at Dragon Tiger: 

* Pay attention to the rank of each card – Aces are high and 2s are low. 
* Bet on the dragon if you think it has a high chance of winning, since it has a higher rank than the Tiger card. 
* Conversely, bet on the Tiger if you think it has a high chance of winning, since it has a lower rank than the Dragon card. 
* Remember that there is always a risk associated with betting, so make sure you only gamble with money you can afford to lose.

#  How to Win at Dragon Tiger 

Dragon Tiger is a casino game where players bet on which of two outcomes will occur: the player’s dragon symbol or the tiger symbol. The game can be played with a variety of different pay tables, and results in a payout depending on the symbols shown on both dice. 

The basic premise of the game is to correctly predict which outcome will occur more often. Dragons are typically considered more powerful than tigers, so the odds are usually in favor of the dragon symbol. However, it is important to remember that each roll is independent, so there is always a chance for either outcome to win. 

Some general tips for playing Dragon Tiger include: 

-Knowing the pay table: This will help you understand which symbols are worth betting on, as well as how much you could potentially win if your bet is successful. 

- Betting on multiple outcomes: This increases your chances of winning, and can also lead to bigger payouts if you’re lucky. 

- Keeping track of results: This will help you understand which symbols are more likely to appear, and can give you an edge in making your bets. 

If you’re looking to play Dragon Tiger at a casino, there are a few things to keep in mind. Firstly, always make sure that you understand the rules of the game before playing. Also, be aware that different casinos may offer different pay tables – so it’s important to do your research before choosing a venue. Finally, always gamble responsibly and never spend more than you can afford to lose.

#  How to Play Like a Pro at Dragon Tiger 

Dragon Tiger is a casino game that is very popular in Asia. The game is played with eight decks of cards, and the aim is to beat the dealer's hand by either getting a higher ranking card than the dealer, or a matching poker hand. In this article, we will teach you how to play like a pro at Dragon Tiger.

The first thing that you need to do is learn the different card rankings. In Dragon Tiger, the cards rank from high to low as follows: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7. So, for example, if you are holding an Ace and a King, you have a high ranking hand and would be favoured to win over the dealer's hand. If you are holding two 7s however, your hand is lower ranking than the dealer's and you would be likely to lose.

In order to win at Dragon Tiger, you need to make sure that you are playing smartly and minimizing your losses. One way to do this is to always stand when you have a high ranking hand. For example, if you are holding an Ace and a King then it is best to stand rather than risk losing your money by betting further. Another way to minimize your losses is to fold when you don't have a good chance of winning. For example, if you are holding two 7s then it is best to fold rather than risk losing more money.

When playing Dragon Tiger online it can be helpful to set yourself some rules so that you don't lose too much money. For example, you could decide not to bet more than $5 per hand or not bet more than 10% of your total bankroll on any one hand. By sticking to these rules, you can make sure that your money lasts longer and that you don't blow your bankroll in one go!

Finally, always remember that practice makes perfect. The more time you spend playing Dragon Tiger online or in casinos, the better equipped you will be to win money consistently. So get practicing today and soon enough you'll be beating the dealers hands like a pro!

#  Best Strategies for Playing Dragon Tiger 
Dragon Tiger is a popular casino game that is played with a deck of 36 cards. The object of the game is to bet on the card that will be higher than the other when both are turned over. The game is popular in Asia and can be found at many online casinos.

There are a few different ways to play the game, but here are some of the best strategies for winning more often.

First, always bet on the Dragon. The Dragon has a higher chance of winning than any other card in the deck.

Second, when you have two cards that are close in value, bet on the Tiger. The Tiger has a slightly better chance of winning than the other card.
