#  Pennsylvania Makes It Easier For Casinos To Get Licenses 

Pennsylvania has long been known for its expansive casino gambling industry. The state has been a leader in this area for many years and has seen a great deal of success. This may be about to change, however, as the state government looks to make it easier for casinos to obtain licenses.

This change was announced by Pennsylvania House Speaker Mike Turzai on Tuesday. He said that the state is looking to streamline the process by which casinos can get licensed. This will make it easier for new operators to enter the market, and it will also allow current operators to expand their businesses.

Turzai believes that this change will be good for the state’s economy. He says that it will create more jobs and generate more tax revenue. This seems like a logical conclusion, as more casinos in the state should lead to more gambling activity. This, in turn, will lead to more money being spent in Pennsylvania’s casinos.

There is already a great deal of excitement surrounding this news. Many people are looking forward to seeing what Pennsylvania’s casino landscape will look like in the coming years. It should be interesting to see how things play out, especially given the fact that PA has been a leader in this area for so long.

#  PA Online Casinos Now Able To Offer Bonus Money 

Play Pennsylvania (PA) online casinos now with the ability to offer bonus money on your first deposit. Casinos like Parx Online Casino, SugarHouse Casino and Mount Airy Casino Resort are among the first licensed PA casinos to offer this promotion. 

According to PennLive, there are several terms and conditions that apply: 

- Casinos can offer a bonus of up to $500 on a player's first deposit. 
- The bonus money must be wagered at least 25 times before it can be withdrawn. 
- Players cannot use the bonus money on table games or video poker. It can only be used for slot machines. 
- The bonus is good for new players only. Existing players are not eligible. 

The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board said that the move is an effort to attract new players to the casinos. "This provides an incentive for a person who may have never played casino games before to give them a try," said spokeswoman Jessica Myers.

#  Gambling License Approved For Pennsylvania Online Casinos 

Pennsylvania has long been one of the most coveted states in the U.S. for casino operators, and that is due in part to the size of its population and the potential market for gambling services. On Tuesday, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) approved the first five Category 4 casino licenses, which will allow for online gambling in the state. The move is seen as a major victory for PA casino operators and is likely to result in a surge in online gaming traffic.

The five casinos that received approval are: Parx Casino, SugarHouse Casino, Rivers Casino, Mount Airy Casino Resort, and Harrah’s Philadelphia Casino & Racetrack. Each of these properties already operates a brick-and-mortar casino in Pennsylvania, and each was awarded a license to offer both online slots and table games. In addition, each property will be allowed to offer real-money sports betting services, pending approval from the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board.

While it is still unclear exactly when these casinos will go live with their online platforms, it is expected that they will do so before the end of 2018. This means that players in Pennsylvania will soon have access to a wide range of gambling options, including both land-based and online casinos as well as sports betting.

The PGCB also approved a license for Stadium Casino LLC, which is owned by Neil Bluhm (a major investor in several PA casinos) and Las Vegas Sands Corp. (owner of The Venetian and The Palazzo). Stadium Casino LLC was granted a license to offer both online slots and table games but was not given permission to offer sports betting services. It is unclear why this license was granted since there are already several other casinos operating in Pennsylvania that are eligible to offer sports betting.

While there has been some opposition to online gambling in Pennsylvania, the fact is that the industry is already thriving elsewhere in the U.S. In fact, New Jersey’s online gaming market generated nearly $200 million in revenue last year, and that number is only expected to grow as more states legalize internet gambling. It’s clear that Pennsylvania players are ready for an all-encompassing gambling experience, and the approval of these five licenses marks an important step forward for the industry here.

#  PA Authorizes Online Casino Bonuses 

The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board has authorized casino operators in the state to offer online bonuses to their customers. The move comes as part of an effort to attract more players to the casinos’ online platforms.

Under the new rules, casino operators will be allowed to offer players a match bonus on their first deposit, as well as other incentives such as free spins and extended playing time. The bonuses will be subject to a wagering requirement that must be met before any winnings can be withdrawn.

Players will also be limited to one bonus per casino, and no bonuses will be offered to players who reside in states where gambling is illegal. Operators have until November 1st to submit their proposed bonus programs to the Board for approval.

The news was welcomed by casino operators, who see the move as a way of boosting their online businesses. “The ability to offer online bonuses is something that our customers have been asking for,” said Chuck Ardo, spokesman for Penn National Gaming.

Opponents of expanded gambling argue that the bonuses will simply tempt more people into becoming problem gamblers. But supporters contend that the majority of people who gamble do so responsibly and that the bonuses will help generate more tax revenue for the state.

#  Pennsylvania Online Gambling Sites Can Now Offer Bonuses

#

Pennsylvania online gambling sites can now offer bonuses to their players, as the state moves closer to fully regulating the industry. The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) has issued a memo specifying that online casinos and poker rooms in the state are now allowed to offer bonuses as an incentive to players.

The memo is not a regulation in and of itself, but rather provides clarification on existing regulations with regards to bonus offering. It lays out specific conditions that must be met in order for a bonus to be considered valid, including that the bonus must be disclosed prior to joining the casino or poker room, and that it cannot be contingent upon future gambling activity.

In addition, bonuses can only be offered to players who have already made at least one deposit at the site. This condition is designed to prevent casinos from giving out large bonuses upfront in order to lure players in, then requiring them to make additional deposits in order to cash out their winnings.

The PGCB has also clarified that casinos and poker rooms are not allowed to offer rake-back deals. These are deals in which a player is given a percentage of their losses back as a form of reimbursement. This prohibition was put into place due to concerns that rake-backs would give casinos an unfair edge over their competitors.

It remains unclear when Pennsylvania will move forward with regulations for online sports betting, which was legalized earlier this year. However, the state is expected to eventually follow the lead of other states like New Jersey and Nevada, which have both seen significant success since launching their sports betting industries.
