#  Blackjack Escogriffe Now Available at Your Local Dumas Store!

Looking for an exciting new card game to play with your friends? Look no further than Blackjack Escogriffe! This fast-paced game is played with a regular deck of cards and is perfect for players of all ages.

To play, each player is dealt two cards face down. The player then decides whether to hit (take another card) or stand (end their turn). The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. The dealer also draws cards until they reach 17, at which point they must stand.

The player who gets closest to 21 without going over wins the hand. In the event of a tie, the player with the highest card wins. If both players have the same high card, the hand is considered a push and no one wins.

Blackjack Escogriffe is a fun and challenging game that will keep you entertained for hours on end. So head down to your local Dumas store today and pick up a copy!
