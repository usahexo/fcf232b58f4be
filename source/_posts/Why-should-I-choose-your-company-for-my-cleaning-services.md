# Are your cleaning services reliable and trustworthy? 

When you are looking for a cleaning service, it is important to find one that is reliable and trustworthy. Unfortunately, not all cleaning services meet these standards. So, how can you be sure that the cleaning service you choose is reliable and trustworthy?

First of all, it is important to do your research. Look for reviews online and ask your friends and family if they have any recommendations. This will help you to narrow down your options and find a few reputable companies. 

Once you have a few candidates, take the time to call them and ask questions. Find out what their policies are and what kind of training their employees have received. Ask about their insurance and bonding. And, most importantly, ask for references from past clients. 

Once you have chosen a cleaning service, be sure to set expectations clearly from the start. Make sure you know exactly what services will be provided and when they will be done. If there are any areas that you would like excluded from the cleaning service, let them know up front. This will help to avoid any misunderstandings later on. 

It is also important to stay in touch with your cleaning service. Let them know if there are any areas that need additional attention or if anything needs to be changed with the schedule. This will help ensure that your cleaning service continues to meet your expectations. 

If you take the time to do your research and set clear expectations, you can rest assured that you will find a reliable and trustworthy cleaning service.

# Can I trust your company with my personal belongings? 

There is always a certain level of trust when entrusting someone with your belongings. It could be as small as leaving your car with a valet or as large as giving someone the key to your home. When it comes to shipping companies, you want to be sure that you can trust them with your personal belongings.

The best way to determine if a shipping company is trustworthy is to do your research. Look at reviews from other customers and read about the company's policies and procedures. If the company has a good reputation, then you can feel confident in their ability to handle your personal belongings safely and securely.

Another factor you'll want to consider is insurance. If something happens to your items while they're in the care of the shipping company, will they be covered? Make sure that you are fully aware of what is and isn't covered by the company's insurance policy.

Finally, price is always an important factor when making a decision about who to trust with your belongings. Compare prices between different shipping companies and find one that fits within your budget.

When it comes down to it, trusting someone with your personal belongings is a big decision. But if you do your homework and select a reputable shipping company, you can rest assured knowing that your items are in good hands.

# What makes your company's cleaning services superior to those of your competitors?

# How often do you typically schedule cleanings with your clients?

This really depends on the client. Some may only require a cleaning every three months, while others may need one every week. I always try to work with each client to find a schedule that works best for them.
