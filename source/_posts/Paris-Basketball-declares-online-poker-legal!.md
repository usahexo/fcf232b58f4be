#  Paris Basketball makes history with online poker legality!

The French capital has a long and proud history of nurturing some of the world’s best basketball players. From Tony Parker and Boris Diaw to Joakim Noah and Nicolas Batum, the city has a knack for turning out top-level talent.

Now, thanks to the recent legalization of online poker in Paris, the basketball scene there is about to get even bigger and better. That’s because more and more top players are likely to switch to poker as their main source of income, thus raising the overall level of play.

This is great news for fans of both sports, as it means they can enjoy even more high-quality contests between some of the very best players in the world. In addition, it also opens up new opportunities for aspiring young players who want to make a name for themselves in one or both of these sports.

So far, things are looking good for Paris poker and basketball. The only question now is how long it will be before other cities around the world follow suit and legalize online poker? Only time will tell!

#  Paris Basketball pioneers new era of online poker legality!

The headlines say it all – Paris Basketball is leading the way for a new era of online poker legality! The French capital’s team has been making waves in the online poker world in recent years, with some of the most innovative and cutting-edge gameplay to be found anywhere. The Paris team has even been able to work its way into the upper echelons of the online poker world, consistently clocking in high ranks in international tournaments.

But what is it about Paris Basketball that makes it so successful at online poker? There are certainly many factors at play, but one of the biggest reasons may be the team’s willingness to embrace change and innovation. This was on full display at last year’s PokerStars Festival held in Barcelona, when Paris Basketball became the first ever team to win an event using 8-game mix format!

This was a truly historic victory, not just because it was the first time a team had won an event using this format, but also because it demonstrated just how versatile and adaptable the Paris team is. No other team has been able to replicate their success in 8-game mix, proving that Paris Basketball is truly at the forefront of modern poker strategy.

Of course, this innovation doesn’t come cheap – but it has certainly paid off for Paris Basketball. In addition to their many tournament victories, the French team has also generated millions of dollars in revenue from online poker. This puts them among the top earners in the field, and firmly establishes them as one of the pioneers of modern online poker.

So if you want to see what innovation and cutting-edge strategy can do for your game, make sure to check out Paris Basketball! You won’t be disappointed.

#  Online poker legal thanks to Paris Basketball!

Paris Basketball may have just legalized online poker in France!

The French National Assembly voted on a new law on December 21, 2017 that would legalize and regulate online poker in the country. The new law is expected to go into effect in early 2018. The news was first reported by PokerNews.com.

This is great news for online poker players in France, as it will provide a regulated and safe environment in which to play. It will also provide much-needed tax revenue for the French government.

The new law will allow licensed operators to offer online poker to French players. Licensing fees will be set at €1 million per operator, and operators will be required to pay a 20% tax on gross gaming revenue.

Online poker has been illegal in France since 2010, when the country's parliament passed a bill that banned all forms of online gambling. However, that bill was later overturned by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). The new law is based on the ECJ's ruling that online poker is a game of skill and not a game of chance.

The regulation of online poker in France is long overdue, and we hope other countries will soon follow suit. Online poker is a fun and exciting way to spend some time, and it should be available to everyone who wants to play, regardless of where they live.
