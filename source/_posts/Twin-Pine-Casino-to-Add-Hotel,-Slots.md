#  Twin Pine Casino to Add Hotel, Slots

The Twin Pine Casino and Hotel in Middletown is set to undergo an expansion that will include the addition of a hotel and up to 950 slot machines. The casino, which is currently owned by the Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians, has been given the green light by the federal government to begin construction on the new facilities.

The planned expansion also includes a new restaurant, additional meeting space, and a revamped casino floor. The hotel will have 83 rooms and will be located adjacent to the casino itself. The new slot machines will be installed in a separate building.

While the tribe has not announced a specific start date for construction, they promise that it will be underway very soon. In addition to creating jobs for construction workers, the expansion is also expected to create around 100 permanent jobs when it is completed.

The Twin Pine Casino has been in operation since 1992 and is one of Northern California's largest casinos. It features table games, blackjack, Pai Gow poker, slots, and bingo.

#  Twin Pine Casino to Add Hotel and 400 New Slots

The Twin Pine Casino recently announced plans to expand their casino with a new hotel and 400 new slots. This is great news for the casino and the community, as it will create jobs and bring in more tourism dollars.

The hotel will be a 43-room lodge, which is much needed in the area. The casino has been struggling to keep up with the competition from nearby casinos, so this expansion is a necessary step.

The new slots will be of the latest technology, providing a more exciting experience for players. This is also good news for the casino, as they will be able to stay competitive and attract new players.

We are excited to see this expansion come to fruition and hope that it will be a great benefit for the community.

#  Twin Pine Casino Plans to Expand with New Hotel and Slot Machines

Plans are in the works for Twin Pine Casino to expand their services. A new hotel is set to be built, as well as an increase in slot machines. This will bring new jobs to the area and increase tourism.

The casino is owned by the federally recognized tribe of Miwok Indians and it has been a staple in the community since it first opened its doors in 1994. The new expansion project is expected to create 100 construction jobs and an additional 200 jobs when the facility opens.

The hotel will have 90 rooms and will be located right next to the casino. It is hoped that the expansion project will bring more people to the area, thereby benefiting local businesses as well. The new hotel is expected to be completed by early 2019.

In addition, Twin Pine Casino plans to install 450 new slot machines. This is in response to the passage of Proposition 1A back in November of 2016. That proposition allowed for casinos in California to increase their number of slot machines by up to 20%.

“With the recent changes approved by voters, we are excited about our future and what this means for Twin Pine Casino Resort,” said tribal Chairwoman Tina Cuichel in a statement issued Wednesday morning. “Our team has been working hard on this project and we can’t wait to get started on construction. This will create jobs not only during construction but also once we are up and running creating even more opportunities for our tribal members and other locals who are looking for work” she continued.

The tribe is planning on investing $45 million into the expansion project which is estimated to bring in an additional $4 million annually to the local economy once it is completed.

#  Twin Pine Casino Adding 400 New Slots, Hotel on Site Soon

The Twin Pine Casino Resort is expanding! The casino is set to add 400 new slots and a 120-room hotel in the near future.

The casino resort is located in Middletown, California, just a few minutes away from the world-famous Napa Valley wine country. The new expansion is set to bring more jobs and tourism to the area.

In addition to the new hotel and slots, the Twin Pine Casino Resort will also be adding a new restaurant. The goal is to make the casino resort more of a destination location and attract people from all over Northern California.

“We are excited about our plans for expansion here at Twin Pine Casino Resort,” said General Manager Praveen Gangwani. “This is going to create more jobs and bring more tourism to Middletown and the surrounding areas. We look forward to welcoming guests from all over Northern California very soon.”

#  Expansion in the Works for Twin Pine Casino – this Time with a Hotel and More Slots

The long-awaited expansion of the Twin Pine Casino is coming soon, with a hotel and more slots among the new amenities planned. The work is scheduled to commence in early 2019 and should be completed by the end of that year.

The casino has been a landmark in the region since it opened in 1992, and this latest expansion will only add to its appeal. The hotel will be a 140-room facility, while the additional slots will bring the total up to 670. There will also be a new restaurant and bar added as part of the project.

One aspect that is sure to please local residents is that the expansion is being funded entirely by the casino itself. This means there will be no increase in taxes needed to pay for it. In addition, all existing jobs at the casino will be preserved, with no layoffs planned as part of the project.

There has been some discussion about expanding gambling in California in recent years, but so far nothing has come of it. In the meantime, casinos like Twin Pine can continue to offer a great experience for players, with plenty of new attractions on tap for those who visit.
