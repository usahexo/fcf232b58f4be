# Spanish Blackjack

Spanish blackjack is perhaps one of the most well-known alternative blackjack variants. This game is played with eight decks, and features a number of rule changes that make the game more player-friendly. For instance, players can double down on any two cards, and split any pair. In addition, players can also take insurance and surrender. The dealer hits soft 17, meaning that a hand consisting of an Ace and a six will be counted as a seven when determining whether the dealer has busted. These rule changes make for a more exciting and engaging game for players.

# Double Exposure Blackjack

Double exposure blackjack is another variant that is growing in popularity. This game is played with eight decks, and features dealers who expose both their cards to players. This gives players a greater chance to win, as they can see what the dealer has and plan their moves accordingly. In addition, players may also double down on any two cards and split any pair. The dealer stands on all 17s, making it slightly easier for players to win hands. As with Spanish blackjack, this variant is becoming increasingly popular due to its relatively low house edge and engaging gameplay.

# Roulette Blackjack

Roulette blackjack is another variant that combines two classic casino games into one exciting experience. This variant is played with six decks, and allows players to place bets on either blackjack or roulette tables simultaneously. In addition, players can also place side bets on various outcomes such as whether the next card will be red or black, or whether the player will bust or not bust their next hand. This variant offers plenty of excitement and opportunities for players to win big payouts.
