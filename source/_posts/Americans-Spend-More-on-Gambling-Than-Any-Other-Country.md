#  Americans Spend More on Gambling Than Any Other Country

In the United States, gambling is considered a pastime. Americans spend more on gambling than any other country in the world. Gambling can be anything from playing the lottery to betting on a horse race.

The first legalized casino in the United States was in Nevada in 1931. Since then, gambling has spread throughout the country. There are now casinos in 42 states.

The most popular form of gambling is slot machines. Slot machines account for two-thirds of all gambling revenue in the United States. The average American gambler spends $533 a year on slots.

Other popular forms of gambling include blackjack, poker, and roulette. The average American gambler spends $365 a year on these games.

Gambling has become such a big business in the United States that it has spawned its own industry. There are now companies that specialize in helping people to gamble online or to find the best deals on casino trips.

Some people argue that gambling is bad for society because it encourages people to spend money they don't have. Others argue that it is simply a form of entertainment and that it should be legal and regulated like any other industry.

#  U.K. BettersEuropean Neighbors with Highest Gambling Expenditures

_The Gambling Commission’s annual report on gambling shows that adults in the United Kingdom spent an average of £592 a year on gambling activities in 2016, compared to £418 in Germany, £257 in France, and £211 in Italy._

British adults are more likely to gamble than adults in any other European country, according to a new report from the Gambling Commission.

The commission’s annual report on gambling shows that adults in the United Kingdom spent an average of £592 a year on gambling activities in 2016, compared to £418 in Germany, £257 in France, and £211 in Italy.

British adults are also more likely to gamble than Americans. The average American adult spends just $220 a year on gambling activities, according to the National Gambling Impact Study Commission.

Though British adults lead the pack when it comes to gambling spending, the commission’s report shows that overall gambling participation rates have been declining since 2012. In 2016, 54 percent of British adults gambled at least once over the course of the year, down from 59 percent in 2012.

The commission says there are several possible explanations for this decline. One is that “the industry is becoming increasingly saturated as more people gamble.” Another is that “the industry is becoming more socially acceptable to avoid and therefore some people who would have gambled in the past are now choosing not to do so.”

Gambling Commission chairman Charles Copplestone said: “Whilst there has been a reduction in Adult participation rates since 2012 we remain one of the most engaged gambling nations in Europe. Our challenge now is to ensure that those who do gamble do so safely and responsibly.”

#  Australians and Canadians Tops in Per-Capita Gambling Expenditures

A recent study by the University of Chicago has found that Australians and Canadians lead the world in per capita gambling expenditures.

The study, which looked at data from 175 countries, found that Australians spent an average of $1,092 per person on gambling in 2016, while Canadians spent $1,040. This was far more than any other country included in the study.

The United States came in second, with per capita gambling expenditures of $563. This was followed by Norway ($541), Ireland ($528), and Sweden ($517).

Despite their high rankings, Australia and Canada both have lower gambling rates than many other countries. For example, Monaco had the highest gambling rate of all the countries studied, with residents spending an average of $5,521 per person on gambling in 2016.

So why do Australians and Canadians spend so much on gambling?

There are a number of possible explanations. One is that both countries have a lot of casinos and other gambling venues. Australia has casinos in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, and Queensland, while Canada has casinos in Winnipeg, Edmonton, Montreal, Toronto, and Atlantic City.

Another explanation is that both countries have a lot of gamblers. A 2017 study by Macquarie University found that 47% of Australian adults gambled in some form over a 12-month period. Similarly, a 2015 study by Statistics Canada found that 45% of Canadian adults gambled in some form over a 12-month period.

It’s also possible that the high spending is simply due to the fact that these countries have high incomes. Indeed, the University of Chicago study found that income was a strong predictor of gambling expenditure across all countries included in the study.

Whatever the reasons may be, it’s clear that Australians and Canadians love to gamble!

#  Singaporeans, Japanese Spend Least on Gambling

The OECD has released a report indicating that Singaporeans and Japanese lead the pack in terms of lowest gambling expenditure. The average Singaporean spends S$208 (US$150) a year on gambling, while the Japanese spend just ¥7,600 (US$70) annually.

The total spending on gambling by OECD countries was found to be US$548 billion, around 2% of their GDP. The United States came in first place with US$93.4 billion in gambling expenditure, followed by Australia with US$29.3 billion.

The findings are not particularly surprising, given that Japan is known for its stringent anti-gambling laws and Singapore is one of the most tightly regulated gambling markets in the world. Both countries have also seen decreases in gambling expenditure in recent years, as other markets such as Macau and South Korea have seen rapid growth.

While Singapore does not have any casinos, its citizens are allowed to bet on sports and play lottery games. The government has been increasingly keen to promote responsible gambling, launching campaigns such as “Think Before You Bet” in an effort to educate people about the risks involved with betting.

In Japan, only pachinko and horse racing are officially legal forms of gambling, although there is a large black market for other forms such as casino gaming and online poker. There have been attempts to liberalise the market in recent years, but they have faced strong opposition from pressure groups such as the Healthy Gambling Council.

#  Worldwide, Gambling Expenditures Reach US$529 Billion

## Gambling is big business, and it’s only getting bigger. In 2017, global gambling expenditures reached US$529 billion, and that number is expected to grow in the years to come.

Gambling comes in many different forms, from casino games and lotteries to sports betting and poker. It can be a fun way to pass the time or a serious hobby, but for some people it’s a full-blown addiction. Whatever your reasons for gambling, if you do it regularly you should be aware of the risks involved.

The biggest risk when gambling is losing money. You can easily rack up debts if you’re not careful, and even if you do have enough money to gamble with, there’s always the chance of losing everything in one go. Gambling can also be addictive, so it’s important to know your limits and stay within them.

There are other risks too, such as fraud or theft. If you gamble online, you need to make sure that the site you’re using is reputable and secure. There have been cases of people being scammed out of their money by bogus casinos, so it’s important to do your research before signing up.

Gambling can also be harmful to your mental health. If you lose a lot of money or become obsessed with winning, it can lead to stress, anxiety and even depression. If you think you might have a problem with gambling, please consult a professional therapist or counsellor.

Despite the risks involved, gambling is still hugely popular around the world. If you enjoy playing casino games or betting on sports, just make sure you do so responsibly and enjoy yourself – don’t let gambling take over your life!
