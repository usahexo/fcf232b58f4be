#  Casino Gambling to be Legalized in 2 More States

In a recent turn of events, two more states have decided to legalize casino gambling. This brings the total number of states that allow casino gambling to 8. The two new states are Iowa and West Virginia.

This news comes as a bit of a surprise, as West Virginia voted against legalizing casino gambling in 2014. However, the state has been in financial trouble in recent years, and officials seem to feel that legalizing casino gambling may help to alleviate some of these issues.

Iowa is also in financial trouble, and many see legalizing casino gambling as a way to bring in much-needed revenue to the state. There is already one casino in Iowa, and there are plans to build more if the legalization goes through.

There is no word yet on when the vote will take place in either state, but it is expected that it will happen fairly soon. Those who are in favor of casino gambling feel that it will bring much-needed jobs and revenue to these states.

Those who are opposed to it argue that it will lead to increased addiction rates and other social problems. They also feel that it is morally wrong to promote gambling addiction.

#  Casino Gambling Turning Up the Heat in Florida Politics

* For years, casino gambling has been a contentious issue in Florida politics.

* On one side are those who argue that it is a necessary source of revenue for the state, while others maintain that it is morally wrong and leads to social problems.

* The debate has intensified in recent months, as several casinos have been proposed for locations near Miami.

* Supporters of the casinos argue that they will bring much-needed jobs and revenue to the state.

* They also maintain that the casinos will be heavily regulated, and that any negative effects they may have can be mitigated.

* Opponents of the casinos argue that they will bring crime and addiction to the area, and that the money generated by them will not actually benefit Florida residents.

* They also point to the fact that many other states with casino gambling have seen their economies suffer as a result.

#  Report: Casinos Leaving Pennsylvania for greener pastures

A recent study by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board found that six casinos have left the state in the past year, costing the Commonwealth over $225 million in revenue.

The main reasons given for the exodus are high taxes and increased competition from other states, particularly Ohio and Maryland.

The news is not all bad, however, as it was also announced that three new casinos will be opening their doors in Pennsylvania within the next year.

This will bring the total number of casinos in the state to twelve.

#  Gambling Industry Predicts Huge Revenue from Casino Pokémon GO

The gambling industry is predicting that casino Pokémon GO will be a huge money-maker. According to analysts, the game will produce upwards of $4 billion in revenue for casinos.

Most of that revenue is expected to come from Millennials, who are already spending an estimated $36 billion annually on gambling activities.Pokémon GO is seen as a way to attract this lucrative demographic to casinos.

"Casinos have been looking for ways to attract a younger demographic, and Pokémon GO is the perfect game for that," said one analyst. "It's something that they can really get behind, and it could lead to a lot of new business."

Many casinos are already offering incentives for players to visit their properties. These include special promotions, discounts on food and drinks, and even free parking. Some casinos are even giving away prizes to players who catch rare Pokémon.

It remains to be seen whether or not casino Pokémon GO will be a success. But if the gambling industry's predictions prove accurate, it could provide a major boost to the casino industry.

#  Lawmakers Seek Ban on Casino Pokémon GO

In the wake of the Pokémon GO craze, lawmakers are seeking to ban the app from casino gaming floors.

The mobile augmented reality game, which has players chasing digital creatures in the real world, has been blamed for a spate of casino thefts. In one incident, two men were caught on surveillance footage stealing a $7,000 watch from a casino floor.

"This is just another example of how technology can be used to undermine the safety and security of our casinos," said state Sen. James Skoufis.

Skoufis has introduced a bill that would ban Pokémon GO and other augmented reality games from casino floors. He said the measure is needed to protect consumers and prevent crime.

"I'm not trying to be Debbie Downer here, but there's no doubt in my mind that this game can be used for criminal purposes," Skoufis said.

The bill has already gained the support of several other lawmakers, including Assemblyman Danny O'Donnell. O'Donnell said he's worried about the potential for people to get hurt while playing the game.

"I think it's important that we take a step back and see what potential risks are out there," he said.

A spokesman for Niantic Labs, the company that created Pokémon GO, declined to comment on the proposed ban.
