#  Dragon Quest VIII Almost Here! How Do I Open Baccarat Casino Mandela?

According to sources, the long-awaited Dragon Quest VIII is set to release on the PlayStation 4 August 27th of this year in North America and Europe. This classic RPG has been given a complete HD makeover and will include many new features exclusive to the PS4.

Some dedicated fans are no doubt wondering how they can access the casino in-game, as Baccarat Casino Mandela is unavailable outside of Japan. Worry not! We're here to help.

To open up the casino, you'll first need to finish the game and defeat the final boss, Dhoulmagus. Afterward, speak with Cameron at Reeves's house in Trodain castle and he'll give you a special item called the "token of champions."

Next, travel to Alexandria and enter the big palace located in the center of town. Speak with King Somnus in his throne room and show him your token of champions. He'll task you with defeating ten powerful monsters that have taken refuge in his kingdom – fortunately for you, they've conveniently left an entrance into their lairs right next to the palace.
