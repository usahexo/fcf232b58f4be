#  How to play three card poker and how much can you win

Three card poker is a variation of the classic card game poker. The game is played with a regular deck of 52 cards and each player is dealt three cards. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer's hand, not the other players'.

The most common way to play three card poker is with fixed limits. This means that each player must stake a fixed amount on each hand. The betting starts with the player to the dealer's left and continues clockwise.

The basic rules of poker still apply: the rank of the cards are used to determine the winner, with straights and flushes counting as high hands. In three card poker, however, a flush beats a straight. If two players have identical winning hands, then the pot is divided equally between them.

There are several different betting rounds in three card poker. The first round is called the ante. All players must stake an ante, which goes into the pot. The second round is called Pair Plus and this is where players bet on whether they will have a pair or better at the end of the hand. There is no advantage to betting early or late - it's simply down to personal preference.

The third and final round is called the Play bet and this is where players compete for the actual pot. The Play bet can be either equal to or greater than the Ante bet but it cannot be less than it. In order to win, players must beat both the dealer's hand and their own Play bet amount (i.e., if they staked $5 in their Play bet and had a King-high hand at showdown, they would win $10).

So how do you win at three card poker? It's actually quite simple - just remember to beat both your hand and the dealer's hand!

#  Can you really win at three card poker?

Texas hold'em is the most popular form of poker in the world, but many people are surprised to learn that it's not the only game available. Three card poker is another option, and while it's not as well known as its counterpart, it can be a fun and profitable way to spend an evening at the casino.

The basics of three card poker are simple - you're dealt three cards, and you have to decide whether to bet on your hand or fold. The rank of the hand is determined by the traditional poker ranking system: a royal flush is the best hand, followed by a straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush, straight, three of a kind and two pair. If you have one of these hands, you're automatically declared the winner - there's no need for a showdown.

If you don't have one of the aforementioned hands, things get more complicated. In this case, the best hand is determined by comparing the ranks of each individual card; for example, if your highest card is an ace and your other two cards are both 2s, then you would have a two-pair hand. If both players have the same two-pair hand, then the rank of the third card (known as the kicker) determines who wins.

One important thing to remember about three card poker is that it's not always possible to make a winning hand. For example, if you're dealt 3-2-6 then you couldn't make any type of Straight or better and would have to fold your hand. While this may seem like a disadvantage at first glance, it also means that there's less competition for the better hands and that players can win without even hitting a pair!

Now that you know how to play three card poker, it's time to put your skills to use! Head over to your nearest casino and give it a try - who knows, you might just be able to beat the house!
