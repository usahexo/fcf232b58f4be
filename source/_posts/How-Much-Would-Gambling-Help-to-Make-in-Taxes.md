#  How Much Would Gambling Help to Make in Taxes?

While there is no definitive answer, one study from 2018 estimates that legalized gambling could bring in $8.7 billion in new tax revenue each year. 

This number is based on the assumption that 35% of Americans would gamble at least once a month, which is a conservative estimate. The study also assumes that casinos and other gambling establishments would pay an effective tax rate of 36%. 

Assuming this trend holds, legalized gambling would generate billions in new tax revenue for states each year. This could help to fund important programs and services, such as education and healthcare. 

It’s also worth noting that gambling can have negative consequences for some people. So, it’s important to weigh the pros and cons of legalizing this type of entertainment before making any decisions.

#  Gambling Could Bring in Millions in Tax Revenue!

The American Gaming Association (AGA) estimates that legalizing and regulating gambling could bring in $8.3 billion in new tax revenue every year. This number is based on the assumption that only 10% of the population participates in legal gambling activities, generating an estimated $83 billion a year.

Currently, illegal gambling brings in an estimated $41 billion a year, so there is a lot of potential for tax revenue growth if gambling is legalized and regulated. And this doesn't even take into account other potential benefits of legalized gambling, such as job creation and tourism boosts.

So why hasn't Congress acted yet? There are a few reasons:

1) There are concerns about the negative effects of gambling addiction on society.

2) Gambling interests have a lot of money and are lobbyists power players in Washington.

3) There is no consensus among lawmakers on how to best legalize and regulate gambling.

But it's clear that the potential benefits of legalizing gambling are huge, and it's only a matter of time before Congress takes action.

#  Dragon Tiger Game Could Mean Big bucks for Taxpayers!

The Dragon Tiger game, which is essentially a dice game, has been around for centuries. But it's now being eyed as a potential moneymaker for state and local governments in the United States.

Here's how it works: Players place bets on either the dragon or tiger. The first player to roll two of the same number (e.g., two sixes) wins the bet.

The potential windfall comes from the fees charged by casinos to run the games. In Pennsylvania, for example, casinos are allowed to keep 43 percent of the gross revenue from table games such as Dragon Tiger.

That could mean millions of dollars in extra revenue for states and municipalities. In Pennsylvania alone, casinos brought in more than $257 million in table game revenue in 2017. If 43 percent of that was from Dragon Tiger (and it likely was), that would mean more than $109 million in extra revenue last year.

Some people think that number could be even higher because not all casinos offer Dragon Tiger. So far, only about a dozen states offer the game, but that could soon change.

Hawaii is one state that is looking at introducing Dragon Tiger after seeing how successful it has been in other states. "It's a game that has some appeal," said Feblyn Lim, director of gambling for the Hawaii Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs. "It's new so there's an opportunity there."



There are already several versions of the game being offered at various Hawaii casinos, including one called Da' fu Dou (大ふう吊), which is Chinese for "big flying dragon." In that version, players bet on either a black or red dragon. The first player to roll three of the same number wins the bet.

#  Casino Tax Revenue on the Rise!

Casino tax revenue is on the rise in many parts of the United States, as gambling becomes more popular. In Nevada, for example, casino tax revenue has more than doubled since 2013. This is good news for states that rely on gambling taxes to help fund government programs.

While gambling has always been popular, it seems to be becoming even more so in recent years. This may be due to the legalization of online gambling, which has made gambling more accessible to people. It may also be due to the recent casino boom, which has led to the construction of new casinos in many parts of the country.

Whatever the reason, casino tax revenue is on the rise. This is good news for states that rely on gambling taxes to help fund government programs. In Nevada, for example, casino tax revenue has more than doubled since 2013. This is helping to fund important programs like education and public safety.

It’s also good news for casino employees. Casino jobs are some of the most lucrative in the country, and they are now becoming even more desirable as casino tax revenue continues to rise. In Nevada, for example, casino tax revenue has helped to create thousands of new jobs in recent years.

So if you’re looking for a high-paying job in a growing industry, you should consider working in a casino! The future looks bright for casino tax revenue, and that means good things for everyone who works in this exciting industry.

#  Gambling Proponents Hope Dragon Tiger Game is a Win-Win Situation

Government officials in the southern province of Binh Duong are hoping a new gambling game will provide a much needed boost to the local economy. The game, known as “dragon tiger”, is similar to blackjack and has been popular in other parts of Asia for many years.

Officials say they expect the game to attract tourists and bring in much needed revenue. They are also hoping it will create jobs for locals. However, not everyone is convinced that the game will be a success. Some gambling experts say it is too complicated for most people and may not be popular enough to draw tourists away from other popular destinations.

Despite the concerns, officials are moving ahead with plans to open the first dragon tiger casino next month. They are also considering expanding the game to other parts of the province. If it is successful, they say they may consider licensing it for use in other parts of the country.
